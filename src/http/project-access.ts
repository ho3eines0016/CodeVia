/**
 * Per-account project isolation for the definition sub-resources
 * (workflows, tasks, agents, memory, skills, conversations).
 *
 * The primary routes (`/projects`) already gate every call through
 * `canAccessProject`, so a signed-in account only sees and drives its own
 * projects (plus genuinely shared/unowned ones). The sub-resource routes below
 * historically only checked that a project *existed*, which let one account
 * list, read, edit, run or delete another account's definitions by guessing the
 * id — a cross-account leak. These helpers close that gap using the SAME rule
 * as the rest of the platform, so behavior is consistent everywhere:
 *
 *   - The unauthenticated demo user (auth off / single-user) sees everything.
 *   - A project with no `ownerId` (or `user-demo`) is shared/adoptable and
 *     stays visible to every account.
 *   - Otherwise only the owning account may reach its project's definitions.

 * past that hook entirely, so every by-id handler now calls this helper
 * itself — one rule, checked at the point of use:
 *
 *   - Entity has a project → the caller must be able to access that project
 *     (same rule as everywhere else: demo sees all, signed-in sees own).
 *   - Entity has NO project → it is only reachable in demo/single-user mode;
 *     a signed-in account gets `false` (the handler answers 404, leaking
 *     neither existence nor ownership).
 *
 * Handlers must call this AFTER confirming the entity exists and answer 404
 * for both "not found" and "not yours" so foreign ids stay indistinguishable.
