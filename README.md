# CodeVia — AI Engineering Agent Platform

[![CI](https://github.com/ho3eines/CodeVia/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ho3eines/CodeVia/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A **multi-project, GitHub-centric, multi-agent, multi-model, Telegram-controlled** AI engineering platform under active development. CodeVia provides agent definitions and execution paths for research, architecture, backend/frontend development, UI/UX, database, DevOps, QA, security, code review, documentation, debugging, refactoring, performance, and release; not all roles have a complete autonomous implementation.

> **Readiness note (2026-09-12):** the [historical completeness audit](docs/PIPELINE_AUDIT.md) reproduced 18 targeted gaps before the repository-first work; all 18 are closed. **Per-account isolation** covers GitHub credentials, projects, models/providers, and every by-id entity route (`/tasks/:id`, `/runs/:id`, `/conversations/:id`, `/approvals/:id`) is now gated directly at the handler, not just indirectly through a global hook — see [docs/MULTI_USER_ISOLATION.md](docs/MULTI_USER_ISOLATION.md). Operator-level admin feeds and settings stay account-independent **by design**. Review the [remaining gaps table](docs/MULTI_USER_ISOLATION.md#6-known-remaining-gaps-not-fixed-here) before a sensitive multi-user deployment.

> **Repository-backed project knowledge.** The platform stores full skills, agents/prompts and prompt history, rules, memory, workflows, tasks, runs and conversations under **`CodeVia/`**. The [repository-state audit](docs/REPOSITORY_STATE_AUDIT.md) previously reproduced 8 gaps (context consumption, terminal history, deletion/copy, legacy migration, error handling); **all 8 are now closed** and `scripts/audit-repository-state.mjs` exits `0`. Credentials, accounts and live queue state remain local by design; keep a database backup, particularly before migrating legacy projects. See the [format and usage guide](docs/REPOSITORY_STATE.md).

### Gap status at a glance (2026-09-12)

| ID | Gap | Status |
|----|-----|--------|
| R01–R08 | Repository-state audit gaps (context consumption, terminal history, tombstones, legacy migration, sync retry, fail-closed schema) | ✅ Closed — `scripts/audit-repository-state.mjs` exits 0 |
| S01 | By-id routes (`/runs/:id`, `/tasks/:id`, `/conversations/:id`, `/approvals/:id`) gated only indirectly | ✅ Closed — direct `canAccessEntity` gate in every handler + regression tests |
| S02 | Runtime dependency advisories (npm audit high/moderate) | ✅ Closed — 0 vulnerabilities (`npm audit --omit=dev`), audited in CI |
| S03 | Admin-level feeds shared across accounts | ⚠️ Operator endpoints by design; project-scoped feeds are per-account |
| S04 | SPA without a build step | 🗺️ Roadmap — incremental React/Vite migration planned |
| S05 | SQLite for sensitive multi-user deployments | 🗺️ Roadmap — Postgres adapter behind the repository interface |
| S06 | Rate limiting + structured logging | ✅ Closed — per-IP limiter (`RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`), redacted JSON logs, HTTP access log with correlation ids |
| D01–D03 | Docs: CI badge owner, `infrastruure` typo, mixed FA/EN docs | ✅ Typo fixed; badge targets the canonical upstream repo; docs stay bilingual by design |

## ✨ Highlights

- 🔀 **Multi-project organization** — project-scoped agents, model assignments, skills, memory, prompts, workflows and Telegram chats. Projects, models and providers are isolated per account (a signed-in account sees only its own); see [docs/MULTI_USER_ISOLATION.md](docs/MULTI_USER_ISOLATION.md).
- 🤖 **18 built-in agent types** generated automatically from your project description (**AI Agent Generator**).
- 🧠 **Provider-agnostic model system** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, custom OpenAI-compatible + a built-in **Mock AI provider** so the whole platform runs offline. Providers and models belong to the account that created them; routing never spends another account's key.
- 🎯 **Intelligent Model Router** — picks a model per task by capability, budget, cost, latency, context size; auto-falls back A → B → C on failure.
- 🗂️ **GitHub-backed Memory** — architecture, decisions, bugs, knowledge, lessons and conversation summaries versioned via commits.
- 🔀 **Workflow Engine** — visual DAG of agent / tool / condition / approval / parallel / trigger nodes.
- 🏃 **Background Worker + Queue** — agent executions never block the UI/API thread; retries, exponential backoff, dead-letter, idempotency.
- 📱 **Telegram bot** — project-aware inline keyboards, natural-language requests (فارسی included) and human approval via Telegram. It receives updates over a **webhook when one is reachable, long polling otherwise**, so a bot token alone is enough — no ngrok, no public URL, and `/ping` tells you exactly which path is live.
- 📊 **Observability** — AI Run Console (observable steps, never chain-of-thought), cost tracking, agent dashboards, audit log, notifications, system health.
- 🔐 **Security building blocks** — secret references, OAuth login, per-account GitHub tokens (every project action runs with *your* token, not a server PAT), role definitions, webhook signature validation, approval controls and audit events. Some global admin feeds are still shared; see the [remaining gaps](docs/MULTI_USER_ISOLATION.md#6-known-remaining-gaps-not-fixed-here).
- 🐳 **Dockerized + Railway-ready** — multi-stage Dockerfile, health/readiness/liveness endpoints, `railway.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`.

## 🚀 Quickstart (local, no API keys needed)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the platform (Mock AI + Mock GitHub + Mock Telegram = fully offline)
npm run dev

# Open the UI
open http://localhost:8080
```

The platform seeds built-in **skills**, **providers** and **mock models** on boot. Create a project and it first reads `CodeVia/` from its connected repository. Existing material is reused; only missing definitions are authored. Real repositories need an active model to generate missing material; offline Mock scaffolds are labelled simulation. In mock/demo mode the system is self-healing: a project that references a repository the simulation never created (restored database, lost mock snapshot) gets that repository auto-provisioned — with the project's branch — and its missing `CodeVia/` state initialized once, so no page or project option ever fails with "Mock repo not found" (see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)).

### Seed a demo project (optional)

```bash
npm run seed
```

### Tests & build

```bash
npm test            # unit + integration + end-to-end (707 tests)
npm run smoke       # one-command live verification (33 checks, isolated port + temp DB)
npm run typecheck   # strict TypeScript
npm run build       # compile + copy static UI into dist/
npm start           # run the production build
```

## 🔑 Security principles

- **Secrets are references only.** The repo config stores `secretRef: OPENAI_API_KEY`, never the key. Real values come from Railway Variables / Secret Manager / env.
- **Webhook signature validation** (HMAC-SHA256) for GitHub.
- **RBAC** (Owner / Admin / Developer / Reviewer / Viewer) gating use of agents, models, providers, workflows, deployments, and secrets.
- **Dangerous tools** (`write`, `merge`, `deploy`, `migration`, `shell`) are flagged `dangerous` and require **human approval** (Telegram/UI).
- **No blind changes** — agents inspect the repo, plan, and open a PR; production merges/deploys need approval.
- **Never expose chain-of-thought** — the UI/Telegram show only action, tool, status, result.

## 🧩 Implementing a feature end-to-end

```
User (UI/Telegram)
  │  "در پروژه X Login را بررسی کن و تست Authentication را اجرا کن"
  ▼
Project detection → GitHub changes → Agent Router → Context Engine
  → Model Router → Agent → Tools → GitHub commit → QA → result
  → Telegram notification → human approval on merge
```

## ⚖️ License

### Direct JSON chat providers (Ptero / MLP)

For an API accepting `{ "model": "…", "messages": […] }` and returning
`{ "text": "…" }`, select **Custom HTTP**, with API format **custom**.
The Base URL is the **complete POST endpoint**, not an OpenAI base URL:

- Base URL: `https://ptero.pro/wp-json/mlp/v1/chat`
- Auth: `bearer`; enter the key in the provider form or use Secret Ref `MLP_API_KEY`.
- Add model IDs manually, for example `codestral:free`, then run the model chat test.

This format does not append `/v1` or `/chat/completions`, query a model catalog,
request streaming, or send temperature/max-token parameters. The chat UI receives
one complete reply. Native tool calls are unsupported and rejected. No connection
is verified until a model chat test is run. Usage is unknown when omitted by the API.
Existing custom providers that implement OpenAI's contract should use API format
**openai** instead. Ptero has not been live-tested with credentials by this change.
